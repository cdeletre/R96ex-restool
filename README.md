# R96ex-restool

This is a tool for [render96ex](https://github.com/cdeletre/Render96ex) that:
- extract assets from a rom (baserome.us.z64)
- build/assemble ressources (audio, gfx, demos)
- install ressources and extra packages to a Render96ex installation folder

Only arm64 configuration has been tested yet.

The script to be called is `install-res.sh`

# How does it work ?
